pypeline - an astronomical data pipeline in python

The goal of this package is to provide a cross-platform, open pipeline for
astronomical image processing.  The bulk of the action is in pypeline.py.
More to come later.

Currently my source of images is my Nikon D5200.  The NEFs (RAW files) created
by it are somewhat of a pain to work with, so currently functionality is
limited to jpeg only.
